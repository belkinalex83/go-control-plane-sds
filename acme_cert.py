From https://github.com/certbot/certbot/blob/master/acme/examples/http01_example.py
ACME-V2 API for HTTP-01 challenge.

Brief:

This a usage of the python-acme API.

Limitations:
    - Works for only one Domain name
    - Performs only HTTP-01 challenge
    - Uses ACME-v2

Workflow:
    (Account creation)
    - Create account key
    - Register account and accept TOS
    (Certificate actions)
    - Select HTTP-01 within offered challenges by the CA server
    - Set up http challenge resource
    - Set up standalone web server
    - Create domain private key and CSR
    - Issue certificate
